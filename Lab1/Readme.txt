Log in to your Ubuntu system, and open “Terminal”.
Click Dash Home and search “Terminal”. Then select “Terminal” and open it.
In “Terminal”, use command ssh to connect server snowball.cs.gsu.edu.
Ssh campusId@snowball.cs.gsu.edu
E.g. my camps Id is frondel1, so I use ssh frondel1@snowball.cs.gsu.edu

Note:
1. Your password for camps Id should be the password for this server.
2. If the server warns you that the authenticity of host cannot be established and ask you if you
want to continue connecting, please enter “yes”.
3. Remember to hit “Enter” once you input the command after the prompt ‘$’.

(3) Attach a screen shot like following figure in your report. Name your screenshot
file as L1_P2_ FirstnameLastname.png (or .jpg). E.g. L1_P2_FilRondel.png
This figure includes your “terminal” and ssh connection.
